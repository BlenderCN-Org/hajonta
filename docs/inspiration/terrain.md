# Terrain

A long time ago I read [Shamus Young](http://www.shamusyoung.com/)â€™s [Terrain
Engine](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=141) project blog posts.
[C++ code](http://www.shamusyoung.com/files/terrain_source.zip).

[Project Frontier](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=11874) is a
newer project of his.  It has a [full code repo with
history](https://bitbucket.org/shamusyoung/frontier) in C++.

[Steven Wittens](http://acko.net/) has a series called [Making
Worlds](http://acko.net/blog/making-worlds-introduction/), with C++ (using
Ogre) [code](https://github.com/unconed/NFSpace).

[Virtual Terrain Project](http://vterrain.org/) has a lot of links to content
about all sorts of terrain generation and display.

## Heightmaps

[Heightmap Terrain Rendering](http://www.catalinzima.com/xna/tutorials/4-uses-of-vtf/terrain-rendering-using-heightmaps/)
has C#/XNA code.

## Grass

[Rendering Countless Blades of Waving Grass](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch07.html)
from GPU Gems.

## Tools

[Lithosphere](http://codeflow.org/entries/2010/aug/21/lithosphere/) may be a
good tool to check out.  It is AGPL-licensed, but the outputted heightmaps
should not be a problem.
