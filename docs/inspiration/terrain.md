# Terrain

A long time ago I read [Shamus Young](http://www.shamusyoung.com/)â€™s [Terrain
Engine](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=141) project blog posts.

[Project Frontier](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=11874) is a
newer project of his.  It has a [full code repo with
history](https://bitbucket.org/shamusyoung/frontier).

## Grass

[Rendering Countless Blades of Waving Grass](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch07.html)
from GPU Gems.

## Tools

[Lithosphere](http://codeflow.org/entries/2010/aug/21/lithosphere/) may be a
good tool to check out.  It is AGPL-licensed, but the outputted heightmaps
should not be a problem.
