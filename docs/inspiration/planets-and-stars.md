## Stars

John Whigham: [Solar Power](http://johnwhigham.blogspot.com/2011/09/solar-power.html])

Seed of Andromeda: [Procedural Star Rendering](https://www.seedofandromeda.com/blogs/51-procedural-star-rendering)

Space Engine: [Procedural stellar corona](http://en.spaceengine.org/blog/animated_procedural_stellar_corona/2014-02-01-4).

## Gas giants

John Whigham: [Creating procedural gas giants](http://johnwhigham.blogspot.com/2011/11/gas-giants.html).
No code, though.

Seed of Andromeda has a derived post named
[Procedural Gas Giant Rendering with GPU noise](https://www.seedofandromeda.com/blogs/49-procedural-gas-giant-rendering-with-gpu-noise).
This has some C++ and GLSL code.

## Earth-like planets

Earth-like planets have atmospheres, fairly diverse biomes, and so forth.
Climate (temperature, wind direction, presence of clouds, rain, snow, ...) can
be modeled.

John Whigham tags a bunch of related content as [Procedural Planets](http://johnwhigham.blogspot.com/search/label/Procedural%20Planets)

[Procedual planets into
detail](http://www.twandegraaf.nl/Art/Documents/Procedural%20planets%20into%20detail,%20Twan%20de%20Graaf%202012.pdf)
covers portions of this.

## Asteroids, comets, and debris rings

Space Engine: [Procedural Debris Ring](http://en.spaceengine.org/blog/procedural_debris_ring/2013-11-11-48)

Space Engine: [Comets](http://en.spaceengine.org/blog/comets/2012-10-26-8)

John Whigham: [Planetary Rings](http://johnwhigham.blogspot.com/2011/11/planetary-rings.html)

## Atmospheric effects - clouds, aurora

Space Engine: [Aurora](http://en.spaceengine.org/blog/aurora/2012-10-29-31)

## Full games with Planet code

[Pioneer Space Sim](https://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer) has C++ code
for gas giants, earth-like planets, moons, star, and so forth.  It is
unfortunately GPL code, so wonâ€™t be using even small portions of it directly.
