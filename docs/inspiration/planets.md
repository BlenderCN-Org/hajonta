# Planets

## Gas giants

[John Whigham](http://johnwhigham.blogspot.com/) has a post on
[creating procedural gas giants](http://johnwhigham.blogspot.com/2011/11/gas-giants.html).
No code, though.

[Seed of Andromeda](https://www.seedofandromeda.com/) has a derived post named
[Procedural Gas Giant Rendering with GPU noise](https://www.seedofandromeda.com/blogs/49-procedural-gas-giant-rendering-with-gpu-noise).
This has some C++ and GLSL code.

## Earth-like planets

Climate (temperature, wind direction, presence of clouds, rain, snow, ...) can be modeled.

[Procedual planets into
detail](http://www.twandegraaf.nl/Art/Documents/Procedural%20planets%20into%20detail,%20Twan%20de%20Graaf%202012.pdf)
covers portions of this.

## Full games with Planet code

[Pioneer Space Sim](https://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer) has C++ code
for gas giants, earth-like planets, moons, star, and so forth.  It is
unfortunately GPL code.
